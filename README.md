Simple tool makes it easier for your team to self manage their file usage! Just use these slash commands within your slack chat window.

##### `/tq-file-count`
Gets your current file usage

##### `/tq-clean-files`
Deletes files older than 20 days, by default. You can specify how far back to go by passing it a number, like `/tq-clean-files 7` to clear files older than 7 days.
